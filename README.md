## Building
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` to launch the application.

## Contributing
Currently, I am planning on using this project to better learn app development. As such, I would be open for any feedback that is provided via the issues tab, but would like to do all of the coding. However, please feel free to make your own forks and use them at your leisure.
